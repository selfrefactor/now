### Adjust text size

It applies only to `Write Sentence`

> Default value is 2700. As lower as larger the text gets.

For large screens value should be around 1300:

### Passing id

- https://ilearnsmarter.com/write-sentence?id=you-ready-new-something

Works with spaces as well:

> There is DB instance with alt tag 'you ready new something' and it will be placed ahead of other indexes. That won't happen if the instance doesn't pass the filters of the current application.
